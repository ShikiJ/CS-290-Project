   <h3>15 October 1997</h3>
      <p>
     Cassini launched at 08:43 UTC inside Titan IVB/Centaur rocket.
      </p>
   <br>
   <h3>18 August 1999</h3>
       <p>
        Gravity-assisted flyby of Earth. An hour 20 minutes before closest approach, 
        Cassini made the closest approach to the Moon at 377,000 km, and took a series of calibration images.
        The spacecraft flew past Earth at a distance of 1,171 kilometers (728 mi), passing most closely above
        the eastern South Pacific at 23.5°S 128.5°W. 
        Cassini received a 5.5-kilometer-per-second (about 12,000-mile-per-hour) boost in velocity.
        </p>
   <br>
   <h3>23 January 2000</h3>
        <p>
            flyby of Asteroid 2685 Masursky around 10:00 UTC. Cassini took 5 to 
            7 hours before at 1.6 million km distance and estimated a diameter of 15 to 20 km.
        </p>
    <br>
    <h3>30 December 2000</h3>  
        <p>
            Gravity-assisted flyby of Jupiter. Cassini was at its closest point (9.7 million kilometres, 
            137 Jovian radii) to Jupiter at this date, and performed many scientific measurements.
            It also produced the most detailed global color portrait of Jupiter ever produced (seen on the right); 
            the smallest visible features are approximately 60 km (37 mi) across.
        </p>
      <br> 
      <h3> 27 February 2004</h3>
        <p>
          Cassini arrived and sent back its very first image of Saturn.
